                I liked this a lot, especially the next day. All that butter makes it lovely. I used fresh spinach instead of dandelion greens and omitted the mustard (didn't have any). Used a bit of lemon juice instead. I used woodear shitake mushroom blend because morels are too expensive for a pasta dish, imo. I would make it again as I love mushrooms. Bucatini is the perfect pasta for this sauce</p>
