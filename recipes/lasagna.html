    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p> <strong>Randy's Slow Cooker Ravioli Lasagna</strong>,a fantastic way to enjoy lasagna without all the fuss! I thought using frozen ravioli already filled with cheese instead of layering layers of noodles and cheese would make a great dish so easy. It all comes together; just scoop it out, serve with a salad, and enjoy.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 pound ground beef</li>

        <li> 1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
            
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
            
        <li> ½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            
        <li> 2 (24 ounce) jars prepared pasta sauce</li>
            
        <li> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            
        <li> 1 (25 ounce) package frozen cheese ravioli</li>
            
        <li> 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef, garlic, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in the hot skillet until meat is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano into ground beef mixture. </li>
        <li>Ladle a generous layer of meat sauce into the bottom of a slow cooker; add a layer of ravioli. Ladle another layer of meat sauce over ravioli layer; alternate with remaining ravioli and meat sauce until all ingredients are used. </li>
        <li>Cook on Low for 3 to 5 hours. Sprinkle ravioli mixture with mozzarella cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted, 45 minutes to 1 hour more. </li>
    </ol>
